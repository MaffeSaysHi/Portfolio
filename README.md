# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!  
This project serves as an interactive platform to showcase my academic journey, skills, and creative projects as a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)** student at **West Visayas State University**.  

The portfolio is designed to highlight not only my technical abilities but also my interest in continuous learning, teamwork, and applying technology to solve real-world problems.
